# TicTacToeTwist
The goal of this assignment was to create a tic tac toe game that had a slight difference from normal tic tac toe.
Once the 7th move was made by a player the first move that was made is removed. This means that the tic tac toe
board itself never fills up and you can never have a draw game. The game also needed to have a few sounds and 
different console colors.
